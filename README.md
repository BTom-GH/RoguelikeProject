# RoguelikeProject
A simple Roguelike game, made in duo for a school project between december 2020 and february 2021.

The only rule that we had was to use Python, but we were free to choose a project. My mate and I chose to create a "Roguelike" game. It's a game where the player is exploring donjons procedurally generated with enemies, and where death is common, needed to acquire knowledge about the game. We used principally "The Binding of Isaac" from Edmund McMillen as a reference.

(Warning : Code is mainly wrote in french)
