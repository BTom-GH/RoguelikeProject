# RoguelikeProject
A simple Roguelike game, made in duo for a school project between december 2020 and february 2021 (minors changes were made after to fit with the rules of shared contents on internet).

The only rule that we had was to use Python, but we were free to choose a project. My mate and I chose to create a "Roguelike" game. It's a game where the player is exploring donjons procedurally generated with enemies, and where death is common, needed to acquire knowledge about the game. We used principally "The Binding of Isaac" from Edmund McMillen as a reference.
We had to return the project before we finished it, that's why you can only explore the spawn and experiment attacks and collisions without enemies.
